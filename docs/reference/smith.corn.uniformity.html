    <p>Data come from the Illinois Experiment Station.</p>  
<p>The data values are from Smith (1910) and the field map is from Harris (1920).
  Each plot was 1/10 acre, but the dimensions are not given. Note that
  1/10 acre is also the area of a square 1 chain (66 feet) on a side.</p>  
<p>The following text is abridged from Smith (1910).</p>
<p>How much variability may we reasonably expect in land that is
  apparently uniform? Some data among the records of the soil plots at
  the Illinois Experiment station furnish interesting material for study
  in this connection.</p>
<p>A field that had lain sixteen years in pasture was broken up in 1895
  and laid out into plots to be subsequently used for soil
  experiments. The land is slightly rolling but otherwise quite uniform
  in appearance. There are in the series to be considered in this
  connection 120 one-tenth acre plots. These plots were all planted to
  corn for three consecutive years without any soil treatment, so that
  the records offer a rather exceptional opportunity for a study of this
  kind.</p>
<p>The yields of all these plots in terms of bushels of shelled corn per
  acre for the three years are given in the accompanying table.</p>
<p>A study of this data reveals some very striking variations. It will be
  noticed in the first place that there is a tremendous difference in
  production in the different years. The first year, 1895, was an
  extremely unfavorable one for corn and the yields are exceptionally
  low. The weather records show that the season was not only unusually
  dry, but also cool in the early part. The following year we have an
  exceptionally favorable corn season, and the yields run unusually
  high. The third year was also a good one, and the yields are perhaps
  somewhat above the normal for this locality.</p>
<p>It will be observed that certain plots appear to be very
  abnormal. Thus plots 117, 118, 119, and 120 give an abnormally high
  yield in the first season and an abnormally low one in the two
  following years. This is to be accounted for in the topography of the
  land. These plots lie in a low spot which was favorable in the dry
  year of 1895, but unfavorable in 1896 and 1897. For this reason these
  four plots were rejected from further consideration in this study, as
  were also plots 616, 617, 618, 619, and 620. This leaves 111 plots
  whose variations are apparently unaccounted for and which furnish the
  data from which the following results are taken.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that the variability as measured by the standard
  deviation becomes less in each succeeding year. This suggests the
  question as to whether continued cropping might not tend to induce
  uniformity. The records of a few of these plots which were continued
  in corn for three years longer, however, do not support such a
  conclusion.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to expect greater variability in seasons very
  unfavorable for production, such as that of 1895, because so much may
  depend upon certain critical factors of production coming into play
  and this suggestion may be the explanation of the high standard
  deviation in this first year. Results extending over a longer series
  of years would be extremely interesting in this connection.</p>
<p>If we consider the total range of variation in any single year, we
  find differences as follows: Plots lying adjoining have shown the
  following maximum variations: 18 bushels in 1895; 11 bushels in 1896;
  8 bushels in 1897.</p>
<p>The above results give us a conception of the unaccountable plot
  variations which we have to deal with in field tests. The possibility
  remains that a still closer study might detect some abnormal factors
  at play to account for these variations in certain cases, but the
  study certainly suggests the importance of conservatism in arriving at
  conclusions based upon plot tests.</p>
<p>The particular value that the writer has derived from this study is
  the strengthening of his conviction that the only dependence to be
  placed upon variety tests and other field experiments is from records
  involving the average of liberal numbers and extending over long
  periods of time.</p>
