### SoyNAM - Soybean nested association mapping 

Dataset with phenotype data 3 yr, 9 locations, 18 environments, 60 thousand observations for height, maturity,
lodging, moisture, protein, oil, fiber, seed size. There are 5000+ strains, 40 families.

Data formatted for the analysis of the NAM package is available with the following command: `SoyNAM::ENV()`.


### spdep

Has a vignette 'The Problem of Spatial Autocorrelation: forty years on' that examines agriculture in Irish counties.
See also the data `ade4::irishdata`.


### spuRs

Data: `spuRs::trees` has data for 107 trees that were cut into cross sections with the volume calculated at roughly 10-year increments.  This is a subset of the much-larger original data from Guttenberg:
