# agridat 1.21

This release fixes a minor problem identified by CRAN.

## Test environments and results

1. R 4.1.3 on Windows 10, devtools::check(cran=TRUE)
2. devtools::check_win_devel()
3. devtools::check_win_release()
4. devtools::check_win_oldrelease()

Results:

1. R-oldrelease was OK.

2. There may be a NOTE about possibly invalid URLs.  I have checked the URLs by hand and they all work (but sometimes are slow).

3. WinRelease gave many notes like this: 
```
aastveit.barley.Rd:17:1: Warning: <table> attribute "width" not allowed for HTML5.  
```
Other platforms did not give this warning, so I assume this is spurious. CRAN check page does not show this problem: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_kw.stat_at_gmail.com.html


# agridat 1.19

## CRAN package status check

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_kw.stat_at_gmail.com.html
Current CRAN status: OK: 12

## Test environments and results

1. R 4.1.1 on Windows 10
2. WinBuilder: R devel
3. Rhub: Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit

Status.  OK on some platforms. WinBuilder has 2 notes.

1. Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
  URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3001959
    From: inst/doc/agridat_data.html
   
Hand-checked that this is a valid URL.

2. Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 10s
            user system elapsed

This was caused by an example with a simple graphic that (on my computer) takes less than 1 second to draw.  I wrapped that example with dontrun{} and then this NOTE appeared for a DIFFERENT example.  I wonder if the NOTE really means that loading the graphics library for the first time  is slow???
