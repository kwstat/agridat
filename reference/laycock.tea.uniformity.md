# Uniformity trials of tea

Uniformity trials of tea

## Usage

``` r
data("laycock.tea.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 54 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `loc`:

  location, L1 or L2

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `yield`:

  yield (pounds)

## Details

Actual physical dimensions for the tea shrubs are not given, so we use
an estimate of four feet square for each shrub (which is similar to the
`eden.tea.uniformity` experiment).

Location 1 (Laycock, page 108) is at the Research Station, Nyasaland.
Plots were 10 by 15 bushes, harvested 23 times in 1942.

Field length: 8 plots \* 10 bushes \* 4 feet = 320 feet.

Field width: 4 plots \* 15 bushes \* 4 feet = 240 feet.

Location 2 (Laycock page 110) is at Mianga Estate, Nyasaland. Plots were
9 by 11 bushes, harvested 18 times in 1951/52.

Field length: 9 plots \* 9 bushes \* 4 feet = 324 feet.

Field width: 6 plots \* 11 bushes \* 4 feet = 264 feet.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

library(agridat)

data(laycock.tea.uniformity)
dat <- laycock.tea.uniformity

libs(desplot)
desplot(dat, yield ~ col*row|loc,
        flip=TRUE, aspect=322/252, # average of 2 locs
        main="laycock.tea.uniformity")

} # }
```
