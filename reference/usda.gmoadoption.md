# Adoption of genetically modified crops in the United States

Adoption of genetically modified crops in the U.S. from 1996 to 2022.

## Usage

``` r
data("usda.gmoadoption")
```

## Format

A data frame with 145 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `year`:

  Year of crop

- `crop`:

  Crop type

- `percent`:

  Percent of planted acres

## Details

HT indicates herbicide-tolerant crops. Bt indicates insect-resistant
(Bacillus thuringiensis) crops. The "percent" column is the percentage
of planted acres for each crop that were genetically modified. HT/Bt for
corn and cotton are not mutually exclusive categories. For example, as
time progressed corn hybrids tended to be both HT and Bt.
