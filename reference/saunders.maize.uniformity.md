# Uniformity trial of maize in South Africa

Uniformity trial of maize in South Africa

## Usage

``` r
data("saunders.maize.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 2500 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield per plot, pounds

- `year`:

  year

## Details

These two maize uniformity trials were conducted by Potchefstroom
Experiment Station, South Africa.

Each harvested unit was a plot of 10 plants, planted 3 feet by 3 feet in
individual hills.

Dataset for 1928-1929 experiment

Rows 41-43 are missing.

Field width: 4 plots \* 10 yards = 40 yards

Field length : 250 plots \* 1 yard = 250 yards

Dataset for 1929-30 experiment

Row 255 is missing

There is an obvious edge effect in the first column.

Field width: 5 plots \* 20 yards = 100 yards

Field length: 300 plots \* 1 yard = 300 yards

Two possible outliers in the 1929-30 data were verified as being
correctly transcribed from the source document.

This data was made available with special help from the staff at
Rothamsted Research Library.

Data provenance: Rothamsted library scanned the paper documents to pdf.
Screen captures of the pdf were saved as jpg files, then uploaded to an
OCR conversion site. The resulting text was about 95 percent accurate
and was carefully hand-checked by K.Wright and formatted into csv files.
