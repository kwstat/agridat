# Uniformity trial of groundnut

Uniformity trial of groundnut.

## Usage

``` r
data("ducker.groundnut.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 215 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield, pounds per plot

## Details

The experiment was grown in Nyasaland, Cotton Experiment Station, Domira
Bay, 1942-43. There were 44x5 identical plots, each 1/220 acre in area.
Single ridge plots each one chain in length, and one yard apart. Two
rows of groundnuts are planted per ridge, staggered at 1 foot between
holes. Holes are spaced 18 inches x 12 inches. Two seeds are planted per
hole.

The yield values are pounds of nuts in shell.

Field length: 5 plots, 22 yards each = 110 yards.

Field width: 44 plots, 1 yard each = 44 yards.

This data was made available with special help from the staff at
Rothamsted Research Library.
