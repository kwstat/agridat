# Uniformity trial of sugar beet

Uniformity trial of sugar beet in Russia.

## Usage

``` r
data("haritonenko.sugarbeet.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 416 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  Row ordinate

- `col`:

  Column ordinate

- `yield`:

  Yield in pfund per plot

## Details

Roemer (1920) says: Haritonenko (36), experiment at Ivanovskoye
Agricultural Experimental Station, Novgorod Governorate. The test area
was 5.68 ha with 416 sections (plots) of 136.5 square meters. Row 1 has
significantly less soil than the other three rows.

Based on the heatmap, 'Row 1' is the left column.

Roemer p. 63 says: Table 4: Root yield in pfund of 30 quadratfaden (1.33
x 22.5). If we use 1 faden = 7 feet, then: (1.33 faden \* 7 feet) \*
(22.5 faden \* 7 feet) \* 416 plots = 609991 sq feet = 5.68 hectares,
which matches the experiment description.

A 'pfund' (Germany pound) is today defined as 500g, but in 1920 might
have been different, perhaps 467g???

Field width: 4 plots \* (22.5 faden \* 7 feet/faden) = 630 feet.

Field length: 104 plots \* (1.33 faden \* 7 feet/faden) = 968 feet.

Note: Cochran says the plots are 8 x 135 ft. This seems to be based on 1
faden = 6 feet, but this does not match the total area 5.68 ha.

Note: The name Haritonenko is sometimes translated into English as:
Pavel Kharitonenko.

Transcription details: The data were typed by K.Wright from Roemer
(1920), table 4, p. 63.
