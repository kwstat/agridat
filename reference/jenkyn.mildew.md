# Yields from treatment for mildew control

Yields from treatment for mildew control

## Format

A data frame with 38 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `plot`:

  plot number

- `trt`:

  treatment factor, 4 levels

- `block`:

  block factor, 9 levels

- `yield`:

  grain yield, tons/ha

## Details

There were four spray treatments: 0 (none), 1 (early), 2 (late), R
(repeated).

Each treatment occurs once between each of the 9 ordered pairs of the
other treatments.

The first and last plot are not assigned to a block.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

library(agridat)
data(jenkyn.mildew)
dat <- jenkyn.mildew

libs(lattice)
bwplot(yield ~ trt, dat, main="jenkyn.mildew", xlab="Treatment")

# Residuals from treatment model show obvious spatial trends
m0 <- lm(yield ~ trt, dat)
xyplot(resid(m0)~plot, dat, ylab="Residual",
       main="jenkyn.mildew - treatment model")

# The blocks explain most of the variation
m1 <- lm(yield ~ trt + block, dat)
xyplot(resid(m1)~plot, dat, ylab="Residual",
       main="jenkyn.mildew - block model")

} # }
```
