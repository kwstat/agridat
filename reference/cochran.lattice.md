# Balanced lattice experiment in cotton

Balanced lattice experiment in cotton

## Usage

``` r
data("cochran.lattice")
```

## Format

A data frame with 80 observations on the following 5 variables.

- `y`:

  percent of affected flower buds

- `rep`:

  replicate

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `trt`:

  treatment factor

## Details

The experiment is a balanced lattice square with 16 treatments in a 4x4
layout in each of 5 replicates. The treatments were applied to cotton
plants. Each plot was ten rows wide by 70 feet long (about 1/18 of an
acre). (Estimated plot width is 34.5 feet.) Data were collected from the
middle 4 rows. The data are the percentages of squares showing attack by
boll weevils. A 'square' is the name given to a young flower bud.

The plot orientation is not clear.
