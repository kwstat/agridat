# Uniformity trial of rice

Uniformity trial of rice in Madurai, India.

## Usage

``` r
data("vishnaadevi.rice.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 288 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield per plot, grams

## Details

A uniformity trial of rice raised during 2017 late samba season near
Madurai, India.

Note: There is a clear outlier value '685'. When this outlier is
included, the calculated value of CV matches the value in Vishnaadevi et
al. If we remove this outlier, the CV is smaller than the value in the
paper. This means that the outlier value is not a simple typo in the
publication, but was the actual value in the original data.

Field width: 12 columns x 1m = 12 m

Field length: 24 rows x 1m = 24m

``` r

  library(agridat)
  data(vishnaadevi.rice.uniformity)
  dat <-vishnaadevi.rice.uniformity

  # CV in Table 2 for 1x1 is reported as 2.8
  # sd(dat$yield)/mean(dat$yield) = .0277
  # If we remove the outlier yield 685, then we calculate .0256

  desplot(dat, yield ~ col*row,
