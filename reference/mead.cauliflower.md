# Leaves for cauliflower plants at different times

Leaves for cauliflower plants at different times in two years.

## Format

A data frame with 14 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `year`:

  year factor

- `degdays`:

  degree days above 32F

- `leaves`:

  number of leaves

## Details

Numbers of leaves for 10 cauliflower plants in each of two years, and
temperature degree-days above 32F, divided by 100.

The year is 1956-57 or 1957-58.

Over the data range shown, the number of leaves is increasing linearly.
Extrapolating backwards shows that a linear model is inappropriate, and
so a glm is used.
