# Uniformity trial of corn at 3 locations in Iowa.

Uniformity trial of corn at 3 locations in Iowa.

## Usage

``` r
data("bryan.corn.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 1728 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `expt`:

  experiment (variety/orientation)

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `yield`:

  yield, pounds per plot

## Details

Three varieties of corn were planted. Each experiment was 48 rows, each
row 48 hills long, .65 acres. A "hill" is a single hole with possibly
multiple seeds. Spacing between the hills would be sqrt(43560 sq ft \*
.64) / 48 = 3.5 feet.

In the experiment code, K=Krug, I=Iodent, M=McCulloch (varieties of
corn), 23=1923, 25=1925, E=East/West, N=North/South.

Each experiment was aggregated into experimental units by combining 8
hills, both in East/West direction and also in North/South direction.
Thus, each field is represented twice in the data, once with "E" in the
field name and once with "N".
