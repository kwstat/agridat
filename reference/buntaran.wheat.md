# Multi-environment trial of wheat in Sweden in 2016.

Multi-environment trial of wheat in Sweden in 2016.

## Usage

``` r
data("buntaran.wheat")
```

## Format

A data frame with 1069 observations on the following 7 variables.

- `zone`:

  Geographic zone: south, middle, north

- `loc`:

  Location

- `rep`:

  Block replicate (up to 4)

- `alpha`:

  Incomplete-block in the alpha design

- `gen`:

  Genotype (cultivar)

- `yield`:

  Dry matter yield, kg/ha

## Details

Dry matter yield from wheat trials in Sweden in 2016. The experiments in
each location were multi-rep with incomplete blocks in an alpha design.

Electronic data are from the online supplement of Buntaran (2020) and
also from the "init" package at https://github.com/Flavjack/inti.
