# Multi-environment trial of potato

Multi-environment trial of potato tuber yields

## Usage

``` r
data("tai.potato")
```

## Format

A data frame with 48 observations on the following 6 variables.

- `yield`:

  yield, kg/plot

- `gen`:

  genotype code

- `variety`:

  variety name

- `env`:

  environment code

- `loc`:

  location

- `year`:

  year

## Details

Mean tuber yield of 8 genotypes in 3 locations over two years. Katahdin
and Sebago are check varieties. Each location was planted as a 4-rep RCB
design.

In Tai's plot of the stability parameters, F5751 and Sebago were in the
average stability area. The highest yielding genotype F6032 had an
unstable performance.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

library(agridat)
data(tai.potato)
dat <- tai.potato

libs(lattice)
dotplot(variety ~ yield|env, dat, main="tai.potato")

# fixme - need to add tai() example
