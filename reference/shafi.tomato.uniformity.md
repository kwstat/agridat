# Uniformity trial of tomato

Uniformity trial of tomato in India

## Usage

``` r
data("shafi.tomato.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 200 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield, kg/plot

## Details

The experiment was conducted at the Regional Research Station Faculty of
Agriculture, SKUAST-K Wadura Campus during 2006.

The original data was collected on 1m x 1m plots. The data here are
aggregated 2m x 2m plots.

Field length: 20 row \* 2 m = 40 m

Field width: 10 col \* 2 m = 20 m
