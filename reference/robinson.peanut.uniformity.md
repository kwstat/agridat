# Uniformity trial of peanuts

Uniformity trial of peanuts in North Carolina in 1939, 1940.

## Usage

``` r
data("robinson.peanut.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 1152 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `yield`:

  yield in grams/plot

- `year`:

  year

## Details

Two crops of peanuts were grown in North Carolina in 1939 and 1940. A
different field was used each year.

A block of 36 rows 3 feet wide and 200 feet long were harvested in 12.5
foot lengths.

Field length: 36 plots \* 12.5 feet = 200 feet

Field width: 16 plots \* 3 feet = 48 feet

Widening the plot was not as effective as increasing the plot length in
order to reduce error. This agrees with the results of other uniformity
studies.

Assuming 30 percent of the total cost of an experiment is proportional
to the size of the plots used, the optimum plot size is approximately
3.2 units.
