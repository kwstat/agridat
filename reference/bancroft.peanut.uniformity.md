# Uniformity trial of peanuts

Uniformity trial of peanuts in Alabama, 1946.

## Usage

``` r
data("bancroft.peanut.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 216 observations on the following 5 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `yield`:

  yield, pounds per plot

- `block`:

  block

## Details

The data are obtained from two parts of the same field, located at
Wiregrass Substation, Headland, Alabama, USA. Each part had 18 rows, 3
feet wide, 100 feet long. Plots were harvested in 1946. Green weights in
pounds were recorded.

Each plot was 16.66 linear feet of row and 3 feet in width, 50 sq feet.

Field width: 6 plots \* 16.66 feet = 100 feet

Field length: 18 plots \* 3 feet = 54 feet

Conclusions: Based on the relative efficiencies, increasing the size of
the plot along the row is better than across the row. Narrow,
rectangular plots are more efficient.
