# Uniformity trial of rice in India

Uniformity trial of rice in India, 3 years on same land.

## Usage

``` r
data("lehmann.rice.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 153 observations on the following 5 variables.

- `year`:

  year

- `plot`:

  plot (row)

- `range`:

  range (column)

- `yield`:

  grain yield (pounds)

- `total`:

  total crop yield (pounds)

## Details

A uniformity experiment of paddy rice on the Experimental Farm at Hebbal
(near Bangalore). The plots were the same year-over-year.

The 6th report

P. 2: Plots are 1/10 acre, 50 links wide, 200 links long.

The 7th report

P. 6 table 1 has yield (pounds) of paddy produced on the wet area of the
farm for 1905-196. (No total weight weight is given).

The 9th report

P. 19 has commenets. P. 47 tables 6 & 7 has grain/total yield for Range
B and Range C 1906-1908.

Field width: 3 plots \* 200 links

Field length: 17 plots \* 50 links
