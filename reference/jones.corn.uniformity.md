# Uniformity trial of corn.

Uniformity trial of corn in Iowa in 2016.

## Usage

``` r
data("jones.corn.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 144 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield, bu/ac

## Details

This data corresponds to field "ISU.SE" in the paper by Jones.

Field width: 12 columns, 4.6 meters each.

Field length: 12 rows, 3 meters each.

Electronic version provided as an online supplement. The "row" and "col"
variables in the supplement have been swapped for the presentation of
the data here in order to be more consistent with the figures in the
paper.

The electronic supplemental data is in bu/ac, but the paper uses kg/ha.
