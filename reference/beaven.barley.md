# Yields of 8 barley varieties in 1913 as used by Student.

Yields of 8 barley varieties in 1913.

## Usage

``` r
data("beaven.barley")
```

## Format

A data frame with 160 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `gen`:

  genotype

- `yield`:

  yield (grams)

## Details

Eight races of barley were grown on a regular pattern of plots.

These data were prepared from Richey (1926) because the text was
cleaner.

Each plot was planted 40 inches on a side, but only the middle square 36
inches on a side was harvested.

Field width: 32 plots \* 3 feet = 96 feet

Field length: 5 plots \* 3 feet = 15 feet

# Match the means shown in Richey table IV
tapply(dat$yield, dat$gen, mean)
