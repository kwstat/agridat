# Uniformity trial of white pea beans

Uniformity trial of white pea beans

## Usage

``` r
data("loesell.bean.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 1890 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield, grams per plot

## Details

Trial conducted at Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station, 1.75 acres.
Beans were planted in rows 28 inches apart on 15 Jun 1932. Plants spaced
1 to 2 inches apart. After planting, an area 210 ft x 210 feet. This
area was divided into 21 columns, each 10 foot wide, and each
containing90 rows.

Field length: 90 rows \* 28 inches = 210 feet.

Field width: 21 series \* 10 feet = 210 feet.

Author's conclusion: Increasing the size of the plot by increasing its
length was more efficient than increasing its width.

Note, the missing values in this dataset are a result of the PDF scan
omitting corners of the table.
