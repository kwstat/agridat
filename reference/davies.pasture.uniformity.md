# Uniformity trial of pasture.

Uniformity trial of pasture in Australia.

## Usage

``` r
data("davies.pasture.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 760 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `yield`:

  yield per plot, grams

## Details

Conducted at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute in 1928. A
rectangle 250 x 200 links was selected, divided into 1000 plots
measuring 10 x 5 links, that is 1/2000th acre. Plots were hand harvested
for herbage and air-dried. Cutting began Tue, 25 Sep and ended Sat, 29
Sep, by which time 760 plots had been harvested. Rain fell, harvesting
ceased.

The minimum recommended plot size is 150 square links. The optimum
recommended plot size is 450 square links, 5 x 90 links in size.

Note, there were 4 digits that were hard to read in the original
document. Best estimates of these digits were used for the yields of the
affects plots. The values were digitally watermarked with an extra .01
added to the yield value.

The botanical composition of species clearly influenced the total
herbage.

Field length: 40 plots \* 5 links = 200 links

Field width: 19 plots \* 10 links = 190 links

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

library(agridat)

  data(davies.pasture.uniformity)
  dat <- davies.pasture.uniformity
  
  # range(dat$yield) # match Davies
  # mean(dat$yield) # 227.77, Davies has 221.7
  # sd(dat$yield)/mean(dat$yield) # 33.9, Davies has 32.5

  # libs(lattice)
  # qqmath( ~ yield, dat) # clearly non-normal, skewed right

  libs(desplot)
  desplot(dat, yield ~ col*row,
          flip=TRUE, aspect=(40*5)/(19*10), # true aspect
          main="davies.pasture.uniformity") 

} # }
