# Multi-environment trial of corn with nitrogen fertilizer

Corn yield response to nitrogen

## Format

A data frame with 54 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `nitro`:

  nitrogen fertilizer, pound/acre

- `year`:

  year

- `loc`:

  location

- `yield`:

  yield, bu/ac

## Details

Experiments were conducted in eastern Oregon during the years 1950-1952.

Planting rates varied from 15,000 to 21,000 planter per acre.
