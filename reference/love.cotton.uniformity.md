# Uniformity trial of cotton

Uniformity trial of cotton

## Usage

``` r
data("love.cotton.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 170 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `yield`:

  yield, unknown units

## Details

Within each 100-foot row, the first 20 feet were harvested as a single
plot, and then the rest of the row was harvested in 5-foot lengths.

Field width: 17 plots. First plot is 20 foot segment, the remaining are
5 foot segments.

Field length: 10 plots. No distance between the rows is given.

Crop location not certain. However, Love & Reisner (2012) mentions a
cotton "blank test" of 200 plots at Nanking in 1929-1930.

Neither document mentions the weight unit.

  data(love.cotton.uniformity)
  # omit first column which has 20-foot plots
  dat <- subset(love.cotton.uniformity, col > 1)
