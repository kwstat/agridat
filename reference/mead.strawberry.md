# RCB experiment of strawberry

RCB experiment of strawberry

## Format

A data frame with 32 observations on the following 5 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `block`:

  block, 4 levels

- `gen`:

  genotype, 8 levels

- `yield`:

  yield, pounds

## Details

A hedge along the right side (column 8) caused shading and lower yields.

R. Mead said (in a discussion of the Besag & Higdon paper), "the blocks
defined (as given to me by the experimenter) are the entire horizontal
rows...the design of the trial is actually (and unrecognized by me also)
a checker-board of eight half-blocks with two groups of split-plot
varieties".

The two sub-groups of genotypes are G, V, R1, F and Re, M, E, P.

## Source

Unknown, but prior to 1968 according to Besag. Probably via R. Mead.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

library(agridat)
data(mead.strawberry)
dat <- mead.strawberry
dat$sub <- ifelse(is.element(dat$gen, c('G', 'V', 'R1', 'F')),
              "S1","S2")

libs(desplot)
desplot(dat, yield~col*row,
        text=gen, cex=1, out1=block, out2=sub, # unknown aspect
        main="mead.strawberry")

} # }
```
