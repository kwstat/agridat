RCB experiment of brussels sprouts, 9 fertilizer treatments

## Format

A data frame with 48 observations on the following 5 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `yield`:

  yield of saleable sprouts, pounds

- `trt`:

  treatment, 9 levels

- `block`:

  block, 4 levels

## Details

The block numbers are arbitrary, and may not match the orignal source.

Plots were 10 yards x 14 yards. Plot orientation is not clear.
