# A uniformity trial of maize in Ghana.

A uniformity trial of maize in Ghana.

## Usage

``` r
data("beckett.maize.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 83 observations on the following 8 variables.

- `plot`:

  plot number

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `germination`:

  germination count

- `earnum`:

  number of ears per plot

- `earwt`:

  ear weight per plot

- `yield`:

  grain yield per plot, pounds

- `stalks`:

  number of stalks per plot

## Details

Experiment at the Asuansi Experiment Station (Ghana). Each plot is 1/40
acre, square in shape, 33 x 33 feet. Seed was sown in 23 March 1928,
four seeds per hole. Holes were 3 feet by 3 feet, giving 121
stands/hills per plot. Germination data collected 3-4 April. Counts of
stalks were made 23 May, but "reliance is not attached to these
figures". Harvesting was done 16-17 August. Due to staff shortages, only
15 plots chosen at random were measured for ears and yield.

Field width: 6 plots \* 33 feet = 198 feet

Field length: 19 plots \* 33 feet = 627 feet

``` r

  data(beckett.maize.uniformity)
  dat <- beckett.maize.uniformity
  
  # QC. germination, earnum match published values.
  # stalks published value is 33091, but here 33101. (Data were hand-checked)
  colSums(dat)

  # Examine correlations. earwt,yield high cor
  pairs(dat[ , c("germination","stalks","earnum","earwt","yield")])
