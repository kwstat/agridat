# Uniformity trials of barley, 10 years on same ground

Uniformity trials of barley at Davis, California, 1925-1935, 10 years on
same ground.

## Format

A data frame with 570 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `year`:

  year

- `yield`:

  yield, pounds/acre

## Details

Ten years of uniformity trials were sown on the same ground. Baker
(1952) shows a map of the field, in which gravel subsoil extended from
the upper right corner diagonally lower-center. This part of the field
had lower yields on the 10-year average map.

Plot 41 in 1928 is missing.

Field width: 19 plots = 827 ft

Field length: 3 plots \* 161 ft + 2 alleys \* 15 feet = 513 ft

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

library(agridat)

data(baker.barley.uniformity)
dat <- baker.barley.uniformity

libs(desplot)
desplot(dat, yield~col*row|year,
        aspect = 513/827, # true aspect
        main="baker.barley.uniformity - heatmaps by year")

# Ten-year average
dat2 <- aggregate(yield ~ row*col, data=dat, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

desplot(dat2, yield~col*row,
        aspect = 513/827, # true aspect
        main="baker.barley.uniformity - heatmap of 10-year average")
# Note low yield in upper right, slanting to left a bit due to sandy soil
# as shown in Baker figure 1.


# Baker fig 2, stdev vs mean
dat3 <- aggregate(yield ~ row*col, data=dat, FUN=sd, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(dat2$yield, dat3$yield, xlab="Mean yield", ylab="Std Dev yield",
     main="baker.barley.uniformity")

# Baker table 4, correlation of plots across years
# libs(reshape2)
# mat <- acast(dat, row+col~year, value.var="yield")
# round(cor(mat, use='pair'),2)
# lattice::splom(mat)
} # }
```
