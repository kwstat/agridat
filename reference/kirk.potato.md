# Variety trial of potatoes, highly replicated

Variety trial of potatoes, highly replicated

## Usage

``` r
data("kirk.potato")
```

## Format

A data frame with 380 observations on the following 5 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `rep`:

  replicate (not block)

- `gen`:

  genotype (variety)

- `yield`:

  yield, pounds per plot

## Details

A highly-replicated variety trial of potatoes planted in 1924 with check
plots every 5th row. Entries were not randomized. The rod rows were
planted in series across the field, the rows spaced five links apart
(nearly 3.5 feet) and with 3.5 foot passes between the series.

The replicates are sometimes dis-jointed, so are not really blocks.
