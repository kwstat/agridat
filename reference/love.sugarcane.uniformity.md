# Uniformity Trial of Sugarcane in Puerto Rico

Uniformity Trial of Sugarcane in Puerto Rico

## Usage

``` r
data("love.sugarcane.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 400 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield per plot, pounds

## Details

Data from an experiment provided by F. Chadron for a first ratoon crop
at Rio Piedras Agricultural Experiment Station.

Field width: 20 "sections" \* 10 feet = 200 feet.

Field length: 20 rows, spaced about 4 feet apart = 80 feet.

Weight in pounds per plot

Note: Love does not give the distance between the rows, but "Soil Survey
of Puerto Rico" says furrows are planted about 4 feet apart.

Love (1943) says the manuscript is based on lecture notes given in 1940,
so the data of the experiment is before 1940.

Transcription details: Data were scanned from source with iPhone,
checked by K.Wright. Thanks to C.Wright for providing a copy of the
source book.
