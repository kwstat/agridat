# Check variety yields in winter wheat.

Check variety yields in winter wheat.

## Usage

``` r
data("besag.checks")
```

## Format

A data frame with 364 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `yield`:

  yield, units of 10g

- `row`:

  row

- `col`:

  column

- `gen`:

  genotype/variety

## Details

This data was used by Besag to show the spatial variation in a field
experiment, but Besag did not use the data for any analysis.

Yields of winter wheat varieties (Bounty and Huntsman) at the Plant
Breeding Institute, Cambridge, in 1980. These data are the 'checks'
genotypes in a larger variety trial.

There is a column of checks, then five columns of new varieties. Repeat.

Plot dimensions approx 1.5 by 4.5 metres

Field length: 52 rows \* 4.5 m = 234 m

Field width: 31 columns \* 1.5 m = 46.5
