# Uniformity trial of wheat in Russia

Uniformity trial of wheat in Russia

## Usage

``` r
data("jurowski.wheat.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 480 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield, Pud per plot

## Details

The experiment was conducted in Russia at Ofrossimowka. This word
"Ofrossimowka" appeared in the German text of Sapehin, but is otherwise
extremely difficult to find. There may be alternate ways the actual
Russian name is translated into German/English.

Likewise, the name "Jurowski" is very difficult to find and may have
other transliterations.

Sapehin gives the original source as: Arbeiten d. Vers.-St. d. Russ.
Ges. f. Zuckerind. 1913. which may expand to Arbeiten der
Versuchsstationen der Russ. Ges. f. Zuckerindustrie. 1913.

Sepehin appendix says the plot size is "4 x 12 m^2". It is not clear
which plot dimension is 4 m and which is 12 m. If 4m wide 12m tall, then
field is 48m wide x 480m long. If 4m tall 12m wide, then field is 144m
wide x 160m long. This seems much more likely.

Sapehin says the std dev is "21.8 pud". A "pud" is a Russian unit of
weight equal to 16.38 kilograms.

Data provenance: Data converted by OCR from the paper and hand-checked
by K.Wright.
