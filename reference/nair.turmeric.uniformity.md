# Uniformity trial of turmeric.

Uniformity trial of turmeric in India, 1984.

## Usage

``` r
data("nair.turmeric.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 864 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `row`:

  row ordinate

- `col`:

  column ordinate

- `yield`:

  yield, grams per plot

## Details

An experiment conducted at the College of Horticulture, Vellanikkara,
India, in 1984. The crop was grown in raised beds.

The gross experimental area was 74.2 m long x 15.2 m wide. Small
elevated beds 0.6 m x 1.5 m were raised providing channels of 0.4 m
around each bed. One row of beds all around the experiment was discarded
to eliminate border effects. After discarding the borders, there were
432 beds in the experiment. At the time of harvest, each bed was divided
into equal plots of size .6 m x .75 m, and the yield from each plot was
recorded.

Field map on page 64 of Nair. Nair focused mostly on the statistical
methods and did not discuss the actual experimental results in very much
detail.

There are an excess number of plots with 0 yield.

Field length: 14 plots \* .6 m + 13 alleys \* .4 m = 13.6 m

Field width: 72 plots \* .75 m + 35 alleys \* .4 m = 68 m

Data found in the appendix.
