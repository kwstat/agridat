# Uniformity trial of cotton

Uniformity trial of cotton in Greece, 1938

## Usage

``` r
data("christidis.cotton.uniformity")
```

## Format

A data frame with 1024 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `col`:

  column

- `row`:

  row

- `yield`:

  yield, kg/unit

- `block`:

  block factor

## Details

The experiment was conducted in 1938 at Sindos by the Greek Cotton
Research Institute.

Each block consisted of 20 rows, 1 meter apart and 66 meters long. Two
rows on each side and 1 meter on each end were removed for borders. Each
row was divided into 4 meter-lengths and harvested separately. There
were 4 blocks, oriented at 0, 30, 60, 90 degrees.

Each block contained 16 rows, each 64 meters long.

Field width: 16 units \* 4 m = 64 m

Field depth: 16 rows \* 1 m = 16 m

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

library(agridat)
data(christidis.cotton.uniformity)
dat <- christidis.cotton.uniformity
  
# Match the mean yields in table 2. Not sure why '16' is needed
# sapply(split(dat$yield, dat$block), mean)*16
  
libs(desplot)
dat$yld <- dat$yield/4*1000 # re-scale to match Christidis fig 1
desplot(dat, yld ~ col*row|block,
        flip=TRUE, aspect=(16)/(64),
        main="christidis.cotton.uniformity")

} # }  
```
