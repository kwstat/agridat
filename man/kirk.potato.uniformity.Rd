\usage{data("kirk.potato.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 36 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row ordinate}
    \item{\code{col}}{column ordinate}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield per plot in pounds}
  }

\details{
  Early Ohio potatoes. Conducted at University of Saskatchewan.
  No date give, but 1928 is likely.
  The yield for each plot is not given explicitly, but Kirk published
  another paper about potato yields a few years earlier in which the
  plot yield was given in pounds.
  
  The field was 132 feet wide, 300 feet long.
  There were 96 rows 132 feet long. Each row separated by 3 feet.
  Each row was harvested in 22 foot long segments, 6 per row.
  Within each row, individual potato plants were spaced 2 feet apart.
  
  The field was divided into sections. The data here are for Section A.
  Each experimental unit being 12 feet deep by 22 feet wide.

  Field width: 6 plots x 22 feet = 132 feet

  Field length: 6 plots x 12 feet = 72 feet

  Data provenance: Prepared by K.Wright.
