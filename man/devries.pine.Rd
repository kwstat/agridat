\details{
  Experiment conducted on Caribbean Pine at Coebiti in Surinam (Long 55
  28 30 W, Lat 5 18 5 N). Land was cleared in Jan 1965 and planted May
  1965. Each experimental plot was 60m x 60m. Roads 10 m wide run
  between the rows. Each block is thus 180m wide and 200m deep. Data
  were collected only on 40m x 40m plots in the center of each
  experimental unit. Plots were thinned in 1972 and 1975.  
  The two treatment factors (spacing, thinning) were assigned in a
  Graeco-Latin Square design.
  
  Spacing: A=2.5, B=3, C=3.5. Thinning: Z=low, M=medium, S=heavy.

  Field width: 4 blocks x 180 m = 720 m
  
  Field length: 1 block x 200 m = 200 m.
