\details{

  The authors were from Agricultural University of Dublany near
  Lemberg. (Originally Poland, but now Ukraine.) The experiments were
  carried out on the fields of the Dublany estate.

  Gorski & Stefaniow (1917) does not show the layout of the plots. They
  say more details are given in the journal "Roczniki nauk rolniczych".
  (Not yet found)
  
  Kotowski (1924) does shows the layout of the plots.

  Field F1
  
  The loamy field was sown with early oats "Rychlik mikulicki".
  There were measured 200 plots of 9 square meters each and
  harvested them in one day with a sickle. Two days later, the harvest
  yield from each plot was determined. We were unable to determine the
  harvest from plots no. 161, 163, 182, so only the harvest from 197
  (instead of 200) plots was processed.

  Field width: 10 plots x 3 m = 30 m
  
  Field length: 20 plots x 3 m = 60 m

  Field F2

  The loess field used "Ligowo" oats on 300 9 sq m plots.

  Transcription details: Data were typed and checked by K.Wright 2024.12.11.
  Text translation via Google Translate.
  The actual plot dimensions are not given, but 3m by 3m is a good
  approximation or may be exact.
