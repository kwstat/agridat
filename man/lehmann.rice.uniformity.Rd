\details{

  A uniformity experiment of paddy rice on the Experimental Farm at
  Hebbal (near Bangalore). The plots were the same year-over-year.

  The 6th report

  P. 2: Plots are 1/10 acre, 50 links wide, 200 links long.

  The 7th report

  P. 6 table 1 has yield (pounds) of paddy produced on the wet area of
  the farm for 1905-196. (No total weight weight is given). 

  The 9th report

  P. 19 has commenets.
  P. 47 tables 6 & 7 has grain/total yield for Range B and Range C
  1906-1908.

  Field width: 3 plots * 200 links

  Field length: 17 plots * 50 links
