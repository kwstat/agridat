\details{
  Experiment at the Asuansi Experiment Station (Ghana).
  Each plot is 1/40 acre, square in shape, 33 x 33 feet.
  Seed was sown in 23 March 1928, four seeds per hole.
  Holes were 3 feet by 3 feet, giving 121 stands/hills per plot.
  Germination data collected 3-4 April.
  Counts of stalks were made 23 May, but
  "reliance is not attached to these figures".
  Harvesting was done 16-17 August.
  Due to staff shortages, only 15 plots chosen at random were measured
  for ears and yield.

  Field width: 6 plots * 33 feet = 198 feet

  Field length: 19 plots * 33 feet = 627 feet

  Data typed by hand and checked by K.Wright 2024.12.06.
