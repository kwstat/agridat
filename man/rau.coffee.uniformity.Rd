\usage{data("rau.coffee.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 144 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row ordinate}
    \item{\code{col}}{column ordinate}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield per plot, pounds}
  }
}
\details{

  An experiment at the Balehonnur Coffee Experiment Station, India.
  An area about 2 acres in size was selected.
  The yields are the total of 3 pickings in 1936 and 1937.
  
  Field length: 12 rows * 12 feet = 144 ft (each basic unit is 2 rows of trees, about 6 feet apart)

  Field width: 12 column * 30 feet = 360 ft (each basic unit is 5 trees, about 6 feet apart)

  Note: Rau does not specify exactly which ordinate of the plots in
  Table 1 has 2 trees and which ordinate has 5 trees, but given the
  shape of Table 1 (much wider than tall) and the logical arrangement of
  data, we believe we have the dimensions correct.
  
  Transcription details: An iPhone was used to capture the text in Table
  1, page 82, which was then manually corrected by K.Wright 2025.08.13.
