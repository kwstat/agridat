  Kotowski (Google translate): I examined the experimental field of the
  Vegetable Cultivation and Breeding Plant in Skierniewice. The material
  was provided by "Wohltmany" Lochowa potatoes. They were planted on 5
  May 1922 on two adjacent plots, combined into one complex; the soil
  was strong, "even" on the surface, not supplied with manure or mineral
  fertilizers for 3 years, the previous crop was two-year clover
  ploughed in autumn. The development of potatoes, initially weak, due
  to drought, later (from August) much better. They were dug on 12 Oct
  in such a way that 48 plots were marked out on one plot (field 1), and
  104 plots on the other (field 2); the plot was 10 m long and 5 rows of
  potatoes wide, 50 cm apart, so the plot area should theoretically have
  been 25 sq m, but in reality it could have had minor deviations. The
  entire number of tufts (tubers?) was weighed from each plot, and then
  the starch was determined twice on Reimann's scales immediately after
  the digging was finished.
  
  Field F1 width: 12 plots * 2.5 m = 30 m

  Field F1 length: 4 plots * 10m = 40 m

  Field F2 width: 26 plots * 2.5 m = 67 m

  Field F2 length: 4 plots * 10m = 40 m
