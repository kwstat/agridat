  Potato yields in single-drill plots

\usage{data("connolly.potato")}
\format{
  A data frame with 80 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{rep}}{block}
    \item{\code{gen}}{variety}
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, kg/ha}
    \item{\code{matur}}{maturity group}
  }
}
\details{

  Connolly et el use this data to illustrate how yield can be affected
  by competition from neighboring plots.

  This data uses M1, M2, M3 for maturity, while Connolly et al use
  FE (first early), SE (second early) and M (maincrop).

  The trial was 20 sections, each of which was an independent row of 20
  drills.  The data here are four reps of single-drill plots from
  sections 1, 6, 11, and 16.

  The neighbor covariate for a plot is defined as the average of the
  plots to the left and right.  For drills at the edge of the trial, the
  covariate was the average of the one neighboring plot yield and the
  section (i.e. rep) mean.

  It would be interesting to fit a model that uses differences in
  maturity between a plot and its neighbor as the actual covariate.
