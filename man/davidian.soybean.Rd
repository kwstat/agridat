\usage{data("davidian.soybean")}
\format{
  A data frame with 412 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{plot}}{plot code}
    \item{\code{variety}}{variety, F or P}
    \item{\code{year}}{1988-1990}
    \item{\code{day}}{days after planting}
    \item{\code{weight}}{weight of soybean leaves}
  }
}
\details{
  This experiment compared the growth patterns of two genotypes of soybean
  varieties: F=Forrest (commercial variety) and P=Plant Introduction
  number 416937 (experimental variety).

  Data were collected in 3 consecutive years.

  At the start of each growing season, 16 plots were seeded (8 for each
  variety). Data were collected approximately weekly. At each timepoint,
  six plants were randomly selected from each plot. The leaves from these
  6 plants were weighed, and average leaf weight per plant was
  reported. (We assume that the data collection is destructive and
  different plants are sampled at each date).

  Note: this data is the same as the "nlme::Soybean" data.
