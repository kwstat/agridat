  Corn borer infestation under four treatments
}
\description{
  Corn borer infestation under four treatments
}

\format{
  A data frame with 48 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{borers}}{number of borers per hill}
    \item{\code{treat}}{treatment factor, 4 levels}
    \item{\code{freq}}{frequency of the borer count}
  }
}
\details{
  Four treatments to control corn borers.  Treatment 1 is the control.

  In 15 blocks, for each treatment, 8 hills of plants were examined, and the
  number of corn borers present was recorded.  The data here are
  aggregated across blocks.

  Bliss mentions that the level of infestation varied significantly
  between the blocks.
